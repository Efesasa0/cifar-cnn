# CNN Classification of CIFAR10 Dataset

- **Summary**: A project from EE456 at Penn State University, focusing on using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 images in 10 classes.

- **Tools Used**: Implemented in Python 3.8.15, using libraries like torch, torchvision, matplotlib, and numpy in an Anaconda environment. Special attention was given to utilize the GPU capabilities of a Mac M1 PC.

## File Descriptions

1. **`cifar10NN.vfinal.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation of the CNN for classifying the CIFAR10 dataset. This includes data preparation, model definition, training, and validation.

2. **`MiniProjectReport2_EfeSahin.pdf`**: Comprehensive report detailing the project's objective, methodology, neural network structure, and results. Highlights include the CNN's architecture with three convolutional layers and the use of CrossEntropyLoss and SGD optimizer.

- **Project Insights**: The project achieved an accuracy of above 90% in training and 75% in testing. The report includes various visualizations such as loss and accuracy plots, a confusion matrix, and a batch of predicted vs. actual labels.

_This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks, particularly in handling diverse datasets like CIFAR10. It showcases practical aspects of neural network design, training, and evaluation in a real-world dataset._
